description: In this semi-autobiographical work, published in 1881, Moore details
  his years as a struggling artist in Paris and London. The volume relates bohemian
  life in Paris in the 1870s and 1880s, and is one of the first English books to introduce
  many of the French Impressionist artists who are known today as giants in the field.
